#Experiment 4 - dat250 Rest api

1. got example project and postman working
2. changed the type of serialized object to arraylist and changed the Counter class to be a Todo class
3. added methods for update, delete, post and put. All methods simply edit the list of Todo objects
4. Had to remove cloned repository to prevent it from being a git submodule
